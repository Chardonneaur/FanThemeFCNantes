### Colors

The theme applies FC Nantes' canari yellow and green palette across the entire Matomo interface:

| Element | Color |
|---------|-------|
| Header background | Dark green (#1A472A) |
| Header text | Canari yellow (#FCD209) |
| Page background | Warm yellow-white (#FDFBE8) |
| Text | Dark green (#0E2E1A) |
| Links | Pitch green (#1A6B35) |
| Borders | Soft gold (#D4CE8A) |
| Focus ring | Canari yellow (#FCD209) |

### Graph palette

8 data series alternate between green shades and gold tones to match the FC Nantes identity.

### Background

An illustrated aerial view of the Stade de la Beaujoire is rendered as a transparent watermark (15% opacity) behind the dashboard, giving a subtle football atmosphere without interfering with readability.

### Visitor map

The visitor map uses a green-to-gold gradient with canari yellow highlights for selected and hovered countries.

## Compatibility

- Matomo 5.x
- Works with all standard Matomo plugins
- Purely cosmetic — does not affect tracking or data
